// - created basic HTML files for both pages (Main and Highscores) - created basic css file for overall style cleanup
// - created README folder
created 2 js files - one for the questions revolving and one for general js - adjusted some styling to make it my own. ((Quiz is not functioning properly, but the foundation of the project has been laid.))

// - created 5 questions to get the quiz started - removed bootstrp link from the code I used for the HTML front page setup - now trying to figure out a way to replace with normal JavScript coding.

// - JavaScript is now working correctly

// - reworked some of the CSS to align content properly for each page/section

// - everything looks/works well - now just tweaking small things (alignments and text sizes/styles, etc.)
